/**

 * This package contains the abstract class Building which requires the implementation of the interact() method for each class that extends the class.
 * It also contains Home, VillainLair and PowerUpDen which all extend Building.
 * The enumerator @TypeBuildings stores the possible building types.
 * Further details on the behaviour of each java file is given in the respective files.
 * 
 * Sub-packages buildings.shop and builidngs.hospital are created as they require the implementation of specific classes and it seemed reasonable to store 
 * Shop and Hospital with the respective related classes. For this reason this two classes are in sub-packages even though they extend Building.
