 * This package contains Merchandise.java and Shop.java.
 * Shop.java is one of the 5 classes that extend Building an therefore it implements an interact() method 
 * ( @see Building.java in city/builidngs/Building.java and @see Builidng.java in city/buildings/hospital/Building.java).
 * Merchandise.java is the class that stores the Collectable objects that can be bought by the HeroesSquad object in Shop.java.
 * 
 * This package was created to isolate Merchandise.java (which in needed by Shop.java only) from the other classes that 
 * extend Building.java and their helper classes.
