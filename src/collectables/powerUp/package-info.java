/**

 * @author Lorenzo Fasano
 * 
 * This package includes all the classes that extend PowerUp.java (Armor.java, IncreaseMaxLife.ja , GameChooser.java and HeroesMap.java) and PowerUp.java itself.
 * PowerUp.java extends Collectable.java, but instead of implementing the required apply(Hero hero) method it delegates this job to the children classes.
 * 
 * This package was created to group all the items that extend PowerUp.java to differentiate them from HealingItem.java (the remaining class that extends Collectable.java).
