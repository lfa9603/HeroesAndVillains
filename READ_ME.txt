---------RUNNING THE GAME---------
To run the game simply start the .jar executable file, after the game is opened the first time you will 
notice the GameSaves folder gets created and it contains two files needed to save the scores and the manager status.
Please do not delete the folder while the game is playing but feek free to delete this folder whenever the game is 
closed, the game will recreate the folders once you start the game again but the savings will be lost.


---------TESTING THE GAME---------
Please run our tests from the provided folder containing the program classes.
Please be patient with our tests as they complete withing 4 minutes, we have been 
thoroughly testing methods that delay secondary threads for this reason we have to wait a slightly long time for them to complete.
